### GETTING THERE

It's a well connected area, served by three funicular railways,
funicolare Centrale, di Chiaia e di Montesanto, the subway **linea 1,**
stops **Vanvitelli, Medaglie d'oro, Collana** and serveral buses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### WHAT TO SEE

There are several reasons to go there. One is definitely **Castel
Sant'Elmo**, again the view from the terraces is breathtaking. It's not
free as Castel dell'Ovo, but it should be reasonably cheap. There might
be some event going on there. **Certosa di San Martino** next to it is
also another highlight, with a beautiful view. I only went there once
long time ago. From piazza Vanvitelli, you have to go uphill. The
closest funicular is **Funicolare di Montesanto**.

Another reason is that the area is very lively, as there is a big
concentration of shops. It's some sort of a gigantic shopping center,
but slightly nicer. So I recommend it on a week day in the afternoon if
you want to see people buzzing around. **Villa Floridiana** is a nice
park that also offers a beautiful view on the gulf, and the entrance is
free.

### EATING

Right in piazza Vanvitelli you can have a good ice cream, the place is
called **Fantasia Gelati**. I can recommend the flavor "Benevento". A
good pizzeria is 100m from there, in via Cimarosa between the station of
the **Funicolare di Chiaia** and **Funicolare Centrale**. It's called
Acunzo (if I'm not wrong). A coffee that I really like is **Bar
Mexico**, that is on **via Scarlatti** just 100m up from piazza
Vanvitelli. Finally, the real reason why anyone should visit Vomero:
**Friggitoria Vomero**. It's been in **piazza Fuga** since the fifties
at least, just opposite the Funicolare Centrale. All they serve is fried
stuff that you take away. In the nineties one could easily be satisfied with
something like "2000 lire di misto", that would be mixed stuff for one
euro. It was a lot.
