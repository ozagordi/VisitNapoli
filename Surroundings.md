### POZZUOLI


Visit the **Solfatara**.
A [camping](http://www.solfatara.it/camping/en/text.php?id=camping&m=camping) is
right [there](http://goo.gl/maps/kxVhp). The train stop (metro linea 2, **Pozzuoli Solfatara**)
is about 1km from the site and right next to the **Anfiteatro Flavio**. If you go
down towards the coast, the pubs there are quite popular.

#### Rione Terra

### SORRENTO



A website with some hiking trails (in italian): <http://www.sorrentohiking.com/>. I have only
been in Ieranto.

### ISLANDS

I can strongly recommend both **Procida** and **Ischia**. The advantage
of Procida is that it's very close (about 35' from Pozzuoli), and quite
small and pleasant. So you can actually visit most of it on foot. Ischia
is really beautiful (ask Frau Merkel), and I would really like to hike
**Monte Epomeo** one day,
see [here](http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187784-d246269-r130152881-Monte_Epomeo-Ischia_Campania.html).
Also Ischia is easily reached from Pozzuoli. I would consider spending
one night there. And then Capri, no need for an introduction.

### CAMPI FLEGREI

The whole area of Pozzuoli and surrounding is called **Campi Flegrei**
(burning fields). If you dive, you might visit the underwater
archaeological park of Baiae <http://www.centrosubcampiflegrei.it/>.
Also on my personal todo list. There is a nice beach where I try
to go when I can, just underneath the **Castello di Baia**. Basically
you have to go to [this parkin lot](http://goo.gl/maps/ucvdz), and from
there a boat will take you to the beach. If you are
looking for a nice restaurant/bar in the area, go
to [Batis](http://www.batis.it/index.html), in Bacoli. The guy at the
bar should speak a good english.

### VESUVIO

You can drive almost to the top and then hike the last part.

POMPEI

Interesting to know is that an ideal completion of the visit is the
**Museo Archeologico Nazionale** in Napoli, where many findings are
displayed.
