GETTING THERE

Not entirely easy. Posillipo, the area with the villa of very rich people, is not
very well served by public transportation, maybe not surprisingly. The
area of Bagnoli and Coroglio is served with the **linea Cumana**, the
stop **Bagnoli** is very close to the pontile.

WHAT TO SEE

**Parco Virgiliano**, for sure. It's easier to reach by car. There is an
ancient tunnel that goes right under the park, **Grotta di Seiano.** It
can be visited with a tour, and the visit includes the [archeological
site of Pausylipon](http://goo.gl/maps/27QDa).

The area of Bagnoli-Coroglio is a former industrial site, where steel
was produced until a few years ago. Now the area is (slowly) being
converted into a park, aquarium, sport facilities and all that. I like
the [pontile](http://goo.gl/maps/cIVxq), a 1km dock that you can walk
all the way in the middle of the gulf.

EATING

If you decide to walk along via Posillipo, which is a nice walk anyway,
you find [Piazza San Luigi](http://goo.gl/maps/6odxd). There is a once
popular take-away there, **Elettroforno**. A few meters further on via
Posillipo the famous **gelateria Bilancione**. The view is also very
nice from here.
