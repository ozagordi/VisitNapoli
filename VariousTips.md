-   Consider buying the museum pass, there exist several kinds,
    see <http://www.campaniartecard.it/>
-   The daily ticket is probably the best option, it is sometimes
    included in the museum pass, check
    the [website](http://www.unicocampania.it/index.php?lang=en)
-   Stay safe, no jewels, no Rolex, stay alert.
-   Do not pay more than, say, 6 euros for a Margherita. Maybe a little
    more if the place is fancy.
-   The ticket from Pozzuoli to Naples is U1 (see the
    website <http://www.unicocampania.it/>).
